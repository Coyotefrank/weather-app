# weather-app

In this application I attempted to make a 5 day weather forcasting display with a city search function.
The user first inputs the city that they want the 5 day forcast of and the forcast would appear on the right in seperate columns.
Once the input is complete by selecting the search button the usear will find information such as tempeter and other weather related information, if a different city is desired simply replace the previous input with the newly desired city and the same display should happen only with the new citys info.
